              <p>
                Passionate about Full Stack Development and Machine Learning, 
                I build scalable, intelligent software solutions.
                With a strong grasp of Java and Python, and some front-end experience, 
                I deliver end-to-end systemsâ€”from intuitive interfaces to ML-powered back ends.
              </p>
              <p>
                My expertise includes machine learning algorithms, data visualization, and 
                predictive modeling. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies 
                to enhance my skills and contribute to the field of data science.
              </p>
              <p>
                With a solid foundation in statistical analysis and programming, I specialize 
                in extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets and developing 
                intelligent solutions that make a real impact.
              </p>
